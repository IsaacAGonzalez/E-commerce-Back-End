  ## Description
  This project is meant to display proficiency using an ORM tool through JavaScript to further enhance our ability to use SQL type databases in our applications. Given a database, we are capable of setting table parameters, inserting data, modifying data, and deleting data solely through JavaScript applications connected to our database. We no longer have to create schema in SQL to add data and can add our data dynamically using JavaScript.

  ## Installation
  In order to install and use make sure to initiate using: 
  ```
  npm install
  ```
  This will ensure that everything is setup correctly and the dependancies needed are in place.

  ## Tests
  For testing purposes you can use the following command:
  ```
  npm run test
  ```

  ## Usage
  This repo was made while attending a coding bootcamp, it's creation was intended to facilitate learning through doing. There is still much to be improved as I am still learning more about working with JavaScript, SQL, and connecting the two through Back End development.

  ## Contributing 
  Feel free to use this repo as inspiration or to learn. Happy hacking!
